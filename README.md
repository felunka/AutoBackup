# AutoBackup

This is a very easy and small Plugin, which allows you to automatically save all world in a differed folder. To safe disk space, all world will be zipped before saved. You can set your own interval of backups and how long backups should be kept. In addition, you can create your own broadcast message to the players, before the backup will start.

###Config:

The Plugin will generate a “AutoBackup” Folder in your Plugins folder with a “conf.json” file. The setting you can change are:

autobackup: true|false (If set to true the Plugin will backup all worlds every set seconds)

interval: int in sek (Seconds between backups)

lastsaves: int (How many backups should be kept. If higher, the oldest one will get deleted)

###Language:

The Plugin is in English by default, but I created an example “lang.json” in German. You can change it to any language you like. The file can be found in the GitHub.

If you have any wishes, please let me know!
